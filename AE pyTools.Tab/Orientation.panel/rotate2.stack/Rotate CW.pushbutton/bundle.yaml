    Description:
    
    Rotate selected model elements 90 degrees clockwise 
    while maintaining their position. It is similar to pressing the
    spacebar, but works on elements connected with wires.

    
    SHIFT+Click: 
    
    Force tags to remain in place on execution, ignoring the current tag configurations.
    
    Note: 
    This ignores Annotations, Pinned Elements, System Families, 
    and Face-Based Elements hosted to vertical walls.
