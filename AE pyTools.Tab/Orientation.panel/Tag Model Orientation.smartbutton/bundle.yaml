title: "Model Orientation"

  Description:
  
  Modify the behavior of the orient tools. When 'ON', the tag orientation
  will be kept to "Model" after rotation.
  
  
  This behavior can help maintain uniformity when tags rotate around an
  element, specifically when the tags are left/right justified or are not
  centered on their origin.
  
  
  Note: if 'Tag Position' is 'OFF', this button will have no effect.
