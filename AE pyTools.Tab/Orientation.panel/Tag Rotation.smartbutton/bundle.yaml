  Description:
  
  Modify the behavior of the orient tools. When 'ON', the tag head
  will rotate to maintain its relative angle to its host.
  
  
  For example: Tag head is 'Vertical' and you click 'Rotate CCW',
  tag head will become 'Horizontal'.
  
  
  Note: if 'Tag Position' is 'OFF', this button will have no effect.
