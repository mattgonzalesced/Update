  Description:
  
  Modify the behavior of the orient tools. When 'ON', the tag head
  location is translated to maintain relative position to its host.


  For example: Tag head is plan north of the host and you click 
  'Rotate CCW', tag head will move plan west of the host at the same
  relative distance.
