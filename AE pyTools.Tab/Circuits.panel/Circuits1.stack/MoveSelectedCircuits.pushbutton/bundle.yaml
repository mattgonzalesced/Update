    Description:
    
    Transfer selected electrical circuits from one panel to another. This tool is best used
    in floor plan views by selecting circuited elements that need to move to another panel. Alternatively, 
    user can select multiple cells in a panel schedule view.
    
    
    Tip: 
    Use with the Color Splasher tool in a floor plan to visualize which panels each element is connected to. 
    
    
    Notes:
          - When an entire panel is selected, only the feeder circuit (upstream) will move to a new panel. The branch circuits
    (downstream) of the selected panel will be unaffected. 
    
      - When an element with multiple connectors is selected, it will only relocate the circuit on the PRIMARY
    connector. Any additional connectors will be unaffected.
