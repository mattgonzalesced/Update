    Description:
    
    Connect selected electrical elements with wires based on circuit assignments. After all elements of a given circuit are connected,
    the tool will generate a home run wire on the final element.


    SHIFT+Click:
    
    Select the default Wire Type to be used by the tool. 
    
    
    Notes:
    
    - If Wire Type used by the tool is not available in the active document, SHIFT+Click to pick a new wire type.
    
    - Currently the tool uses Chamfered wiring to connect elements, and Arc wiring for the homeruns.
